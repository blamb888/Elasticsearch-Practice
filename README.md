[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

A demo of the Elasticsearch language identification for search use-cases.

# Setup

First, make sure that you have an Elasticsearch [downloaded](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) and up and running on `localhost:9200`. This demo requires a minimum of [v7.6](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-7-6-0) and a [Basic license](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/start-basic.html).

Next, set up the demo environment using `make all`. This will create a Python virtual environment with the required dependencies and download datasets for the demo. For more details, have a look at the targets in the `Makefile`.

# Running the Demo
